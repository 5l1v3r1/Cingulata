Trivium
=======

This is an FHE implementation of the Trivium stream cipher (eSTREAM portfolio & ISO/IEC 29192) which has been studied as a candidate for efficient FHE-transciphering in the paper A. Canteaut, S. Carpov, C. Fontaine, T. Lepoint, M. Naya-Plasencia, P. Paillier and R. Sirdey, "Stream ciphers: a practical solution for efficient homomorphic-ciphertext compression", Proceedings of the 23rd International Conference on Fast Software Encryption, pp. 313-333, 2016 ([DOI](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-662-52993-5_16) and [eprint](https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/113)).

This implementation was used to obtain the experimental results in that paper.
