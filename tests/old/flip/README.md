This is an implementation of the FLIP stream cipher which has been designed for efficient FHE-transciphering and specified in the paper P. Méaux, A. Journault, F.-X. Standaert and C. Carlet, "Towards stream ciphers for efficient FHE with low-noise ciphertexts", Proceedings of EUROCRYPT'16, Part I, LNCS 9665, pp. 311-343, 2016.
    
This particular implementation is a Cingulata port of the FLIP reference code which was provided by Anthony Journault, Pierrick Meaux and François-Xavier Standaert and is included here with their agreement (thanks for that folks :-)
