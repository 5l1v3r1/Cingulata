Hello crypto-world!
===================

This test is the most simple program supported by CINGULATA.

Have a look at the CMakeLists.txt to see how it is compiled by the toolchain and at run.sh to see how it is run (i.e. FHE key generation, creation of the encrypted inputs, FHE execution and then output decryption).

Go to your build directory (after building), look at the generated files (most notably the blifs) and run that first test by invoking the run.sh script.

You can also either modify the program, the CMakeLists.txt and the run.sh or clone this directory to create your first own round of programs and run them over encrypted data...
