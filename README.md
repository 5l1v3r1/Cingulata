# Cingulata

Cingulata (pronounced "tchingulata") is a compiler toolchain and RTE for running C++ programs over encrypted data by means of fully homomorphic encryption techniques.

Currently, an in-house implementation of the B/FV scheme and the [TFHE library](https://github.com/tfhe/tfhe) are supported.

The toolchain is formerly known as the Armadillo toolchain.

For more details, installation guide and tutorials, please check out the [project's Wiki](https://github.com/CEA-LIST/Cingulata/wiki).

Enjoy,
